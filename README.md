## 👋 About the App
Hyrule Helper is an app to accompany Breath of the Wild gamers on their journey through Hyrule. Throughout the game players often need to search for & locate specific items to complete quests, defeat bosses, make recipes, & more. 

Hyrule Helper can be used to search for specific materials like silent mushrooms or mighty bananas. The results will display on individual cards and include an image, description, & helpful information like their common locations, cooking effects, and hearts recovered. 

Each card includes an "+ Add to Favorites" button so that you can save your favorite items. The items are then viewable on the 'Favorites' page where you can remove them if wanted. 

Currently Hyrule Helper will only show results for the materials and monsters endpoint in the API.
