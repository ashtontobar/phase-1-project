# Phase 1 Project: Hyrule Helper

Hyrule Helper is an app to accompany Breath of the Wild gamers on their journey through Hyrule. Throughout the game players will need to search for & locate specific items to complete quests, defeat bosses, make recipes, and more. 

You can use Hyrule Helper to search for specific materials like silent mushrooms or mighty bananas. The results will display on individual cards and include an image, description, & helpful information like their common locations, cooking effects, and hearts recovered. 

You can also save individual items to your favorites list to refer back to as you continue your adventure through Hyrule.
